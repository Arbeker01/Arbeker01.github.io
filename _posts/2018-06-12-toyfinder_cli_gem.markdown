Whoosh! What a relief; my ToyFinder CLI is finally completed.  Creating this gem was a challenging, but rewarding experiences for me. First, it exposed all the gaps I had in my learning at this stage. Itâ€™s one thing to learn the theoretical aspect of a subject matter but another when those concepts have to be applied in a real-world situation. I quickly realized that truth when I was sitting with a blinking cursor asking myself "now, where do I go from here?" It felt like my accumulated knowledge of the subject matter were just having understood disjointed pieces of the puzzle, not really knowing how it fits together. One week ago, I was feeling on top of the world, because I had completed all the labs up to this point; now, I'm feeling stuck and confused like a kid that had his training wheels removed and told to ride.
