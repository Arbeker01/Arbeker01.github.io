            I haven't progressed long enough into the course to fully grasp the concept of Object orientation, but my current understanding is that "everything is up for grasp" (except for a few cases) in terms of usage. In order words, everything (be it string, integer, boolean, etc) is an object that can be manipulated solely or in interaction with other objects. Imagine in a typical home, the humans, animals, chairs, tables, etc are understandably objects because of their physical nature, but there are also relationships like conversations between parents and children, connection between the WIFI router and the computer, that could also be considered as objects in themselves. In essence, Object Orientation is not limited to the obvious stand-alone entities but could equally be as abstract as the relationship between those entities. So the next time you ask your kids "did you do your homework?", remember that your statement (as an object in a programming environment) is a possible candidate for building a program (or app) that perhaps measures the correlation between parental involvement in their kids education and another construct like relative income (which is an empirical, concrete data).
