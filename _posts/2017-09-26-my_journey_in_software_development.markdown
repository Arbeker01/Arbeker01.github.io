The concept of Software Development had always fascinated me even when it wasn't yet known or considered as a discipline. Many times, I would have a lot of ideas bouncing off my head with no underlying platform to express them, frankly leaving me feeling a little weird about myself at times. Even though at my current and previous employers, I’ve had the opportunity to implement some of those ideas but I’ve been limited in terms of the needed skillset. For instance, I would develop a system to automate the routine portion of my job using Microsoft Excel, but always felt constrained in terms of linking that to other critical functions of my job. That’s when it dawned on me that Software Development would be the perfect vehicle or channel through which I could creatively express those ideas and help the greater community in the process. 
As a newbie at this point, everything seems a little daunting with regards to what I need to know. However, I’m confident that a successful completion of the course would offer me the limitless possibility of being a part of one more “solution” that makes our community at large a better place to live and thrive, especially for the Disabled among us. Therefore, my journey has begun!  Join me for the ride, and I can’t wait to tell you all about it.
