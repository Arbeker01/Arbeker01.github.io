		   This is a simple application for parents and guardians to keep track of the daily activities of a special needs child. It's not only a tracking system but also ideal for providing valuable insight in terms of future care or implementation of a new strategy. As I continue further in the curriculum, I'll add more functionalities or features that are specific to Rails and Javascript. 
			 
			 I created the application with 2 models (Caregiver & DailyActivity) using the Corneal gem to create the basic structure. Then I mapped out the necessary controllers, database, and views to flesh out the entire functionality.  Basically,  it starts with a home page that asks the user to signup or login (if that person has already used it before). Once the caregiver has signup/login, they're redirected to the general list of all the actvities entered by all users. He/She has the option to either enter a new daily activity or edit ONLY his/her existing entry. Once the editing (edit or delete) is done, the user is redirected back to the show page of all the daily activities. Upon completion, the user can logout and will be directed back to the home page.
			 
		   Lastly, building this project was a difficult, but rewarding experience for me.  The concepts of ORM, Ruby, Activerecord and how they ultimately tied in with Sinatra seem pretty feasible as one goes through the lessons, but it's applying those concepts to a real-life situation that reveals how much you've really absorbed. And I feel that the secret is starting with the end in mind and doing a lot of deliberate, sometimes repetitive practice to help solidfy the acquired knowledge. Many times, I'd get stuck on certain part for days, only to discover a new bug once the previous one has been solved. However, I had to keep telling myself to keep going until I finally figure it out or simply asked for help (which I did more often). It's the proverbial journey of a thousand miles; however, I feel that I'll eventually get there if I stay long enough on this road. Thanks for reading, and see you at the end of another phase!!!
