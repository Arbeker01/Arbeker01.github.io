Table Relations entails the interaction of one element (usually a table) of a given database with one or more elements of the same. It’s the concept of using primary keys to describe naturally existing relationships between those information, which could be a one-to-one or one-to-many relations depending on the type of database. However, there’s always a “common thread” that runs through them. 
Well (to some extent) life seems that way too. Imagine how person can perform so many different tasks (at different locations) in a given day, yet those activities are unique to only that person.  For example, you know John as coworker, but he may also have other roles in the general sense of his life. He’s a father, son, softball coach, and a husband. All these roles are linked to this common individual – John, who (in terms of Table Relations) would be the primary key or unique identifier amongst those relationships. Even on a deeper (biological) level, John's fingerprint is a unique identifier that distingushes his actions and being from the rest of humanity even though he interacts with so many different people. Therefore, the next time you watch CSI and see a criminal being apprehended because his/her fingerprints matches what's in the national database, remember it's his/her "primary key" that gave them away.
